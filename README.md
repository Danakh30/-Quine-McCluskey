# Essential Prime Implicant (EPI) Detection and Boolean Expression Generation

This code is designed to perform the following tasks:

1. Generate a map of minterm occurrences within a given set of prime implicants.
2. Identify and extract essential prime implicants (EPIs) from the prime implicants based on minterm occurrences.
3. Generate a Boolean expression representing the extracted EPIs.
4. Extract non-essential prime implicants from the original set.
5. Determine the set of uncovered minterms by the non-essential prime implicants.

## Functions

### `generateEPI`

This function takes a `pi_group` of prime implicants and generates a map of minterm occurrences. The map contains minterm IDs as keys and a pair of values as the associated value. The pair consists of the total occurrence count of the minterm and a set of indices of prime implicants that cover the minterm.

### `EPI_generator`

The `EPI_generator` function extracts essential prime implicants based on minterm occurrences. It takes the `pi_group` of prime implicants and the map of minterm occurrences generated by `generateEPI`. It identifies minterms with a single occurrence and extracts the corresponding prime implicants. The extracted EPIs are returned as a new `pi_group`.

### `epi_printer`

This function takes a `pi_group` of essential prime implicants and prints them to the console, along with their associated minterm IDs and binary representations.

### `nonEPI_extractor`

The `nonEPI_extractor` function extracts non-essential prime implicants from the original set of prime implicants. It takes the complete set of prime implicants (`allPI`) and the set of essential prime implicants (`epis`). Non-essential prime implicants are identified and returned as a new `pi_group`.

### `uncoveredMinterms`

This function determines the set of uncovered minterms by comparing the minterms covered by non-essential prime implicants with those covered by essential prime implicants. It returns a set of minterms that are not covered by the essential prime implicants.

###  `transformToBoolian` and `transformToBooleanVec`

These functions take a set of variables and a set of prime implicants as input and transform them into Boolean expressions. The first function, `transformToBoolian`, works with a set of prime implicants, while the second function, `transformToBooleanVec`, works with a vector of prime implicants.

- Input:
  - `vars`: A set of characters representing the variables.
  - `piVector`: A vector of prime implicants or a set of prime implicants.
  
- Output:
  - A set of strings, each representing a Boolean term.

These functions iterate through the prime implicants, evaluate their binary representations, and generate corresponding Boolean terms. The output is a set of strings representing Boolean expressions for the provided prime implicants.

###  `sortPrimeImplicants`

This function sorts prime implicants based on specific criteria:

- Priority is determined by the number of minterms covered.
- If two prime implicants have the same coverage, they are compared based on the total number of implicants they contain.
- If the total number of implicants is also the same, the comparison considers the number of 1's in their binary representations.

- Input:
  - `nonEssential`: A group of non-essential prime implicants.
  - `uncoveredMinterms`: A set of uncovered minterms.
  
- Output:
  - A vector of pairs containing prime implicants and their coverage scores.

### `selectPrimeImplicants`

This function selects prime implicants one by one, removes covered minterms, and creates a vector of selected prime implicants. It continues this process until there are no uncovered minterms left.

- Input:
  - `nonEssential`: A group of non-essential prime implicants.
  - `uncoveredMinterms`: A set of uncovered minterms.
  
- Output:
  - A vector of selected prime implicants.

This function utilizes `sortPrimeImplicants` to select prime implicants according to the specified conditions. The selected prime implicants are returned as a vector.

### . `finalBooleanFunction`

This function generates the optimized Boolean function based on essential prime implicants (EPI), non-essential prime implicants (non-EPI), and selected prime implicants.

- Input:
  - `ePI`: A group of essential prime implicants.
  - `nEPI`: A group of non-essential prime implicants.
  - `neededPI`: A vector of selected prime implicants.
  - `uncoveredMintermsSet`: A set of uncovered minterms.
  - `vars`: A set of characters representing the variables.
  
- Output:
  - An optimized Boolean expression.

The function generates an optimized Boolean expression by transforming EPI, non-EPI, and selected prime implicants into Boolean terms and combining them with logical OR operators.

This program facilitates the simplification and optimization of Boolean functions by minimizing the number of required terms while considering coverage and other criteria. It allows for a more efficient representation of Boolean expressions.


### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use these functions:

```cpp
// Define your set of prime implicants
pi_group primeImplicants;

// Generate a map of minterm occurrences
map<int, pair<int, set<int>>> mintermOccurrences = generateEPI(primeImplicants);

// Extract essential prime implicants
pi_group epis = EPI_generator(primeImplicants, mintermOccurrences);

// Print the essential prime implicants
epi_printer(epis);

// Extract non-essential prime implicants
pi_group nonEssentialPI = nonEPI_extractor(primeImplicants, epis);

// Determine uncovered minterms
set<int> uncovered = uncoveredMinterms(nonEssentialPI, epis);

// Transform prime implicants into Boolean terms
set<string> booleanTerms = transformToBoolian(vars, primeImplicants);
set<string>nepii = transformToBooleanVec(vars, neededPI);

//coverage chart of NEPI
vector<pi> selectedPIs = selectPrimeImplicants(nonEssentialPrimeImplicants, uncoveredMintermsSet);

//final boolian expression
cout << finalBoolianFunction(essentialPrimeImplicants, nonEssentialPrimeImplicants, selectedPIs, uncoveredMintermsSet, vars);


```
