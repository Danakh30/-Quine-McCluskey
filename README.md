# Essential Prime Implicant (EPI) Detection and Boolean Expression Generation

This code is designed to perform the following tasks:

1. Generate a map of minterm occurrences within a given set of prime implicants.
2. Identify and extract essential prime implicants (EPIs) from the prime implicants based on minterm occurrences.
3. Generate a Boolean expression representing the extracted EPIs.
4. Extract non-essential prime implicants from the original set.
5. Determine the set of uncovered minterms by the non-essential prime implicants.

## Contents

1. [`generateEPI`](#generateEPI): Generate a map of minterm occurrences within the prime implicants.
2. [`EPI_generator`](#EPI_generator): Extract essential prime implicants based on minterm occurrences.
3. [`epi_printer`](#epi_printer): Print the essential prime implicants.
4. [`nonEPI_extractor`](#nonEPI_extractor): Extract non-essential prime implicants from the original set.
5. [`uncoveredMinterms`](#uncoveredMinterms): Determine the set of uncovered minterms.
6. [`transformToBoolian`](#transformToBoolian): Transform a set of prime implicants into a set of Boolean terms.

## Functions

### `generateEPI`

This function takes a `pi_group` of prime implicants and generates a map of minterm occurrences. The map contains minterm IDs as keys and a pair of values as the associated value. The pair consists of the total occurrence count of the minterm and a set of indices of prime implicants that cover the minterm.

### `EPI_generator`

The `EPI_generator` function extracts essential prime implicants based on minterm occurrences. It takes the `pi_group` of prime implicants and the map of minterm occurrences generated by `generateEPI`. It identifies minterms with a single occurrence and extracts the corresponding prime implicants. The extracted EPIs are returned as a new `pi_group`.

### `epi_printer`

This function takes a `pi_group` of essential prime implicants and prints them to the console, along with their associated minterm IDs and binary representations.

### `nonEPI_extractor`

The `nonEPI_extractor` function extracts non-essential prime implicants from the original set of prime implicants. It takes the complete set of prime implicants (`allPI`) and the set of essential prime implicants (`epis`). Non-essential prime implicants are identified and returned as a new `pi_group`.

### `uncoveredMinterms`

This function determines the set of uncovered minterms by comparing the minterms covered by non-essential prime implicants with those covered by essential prime implicants. It returns a set of minterms that are not covered by the essential prime implicants.

### `transformToBoolian`

The `transformToBoolian` function converts a set of prime implicants into a set of Boolean terms. It takes a set of variables (`vars`) and a `pi_group` of prime implicants. It generates a set of Boolean terms representing the prime implicants, where each term is a string consisting of variables and their complements.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use these functions:

```cpp
// Define your set of prime implicants
pi_group primeImplicants;

// Generate a map of minterm occurrences
map<int, pair<int, set<int>>> mintermOccurrences = generateEPI(primeImplicants);

// Extract essential prime implicants
pi_group epis = EPI_generator(primeImplicants, mintermOccurrences);

// Print the essential prime implicants
epi_printer(epis);

// Extract non-essential prime implicants
pi_group nonEssentialPI = nonEPI_extractor(primeImplicants, epis);

// Determine uncovered minterms
set<int> uncovered = uncoveredMinterms(nonEssentialPI, epis);

// Transform prime implicants into Boolean terms
set<string> booleanTerms = transformToBoolian(vars, primeImplicants);
```

Please make sure to adapt the code and functions to your specific use case and data.
